# Interactive REPL - Implementation Status

## Overview

The interactive REPL mode has been implemented using a simpler spawn-based approach instead of the originally planned fork-with-pre-warming design. This change was made to ensure compatibility with interactive prompts and maintain code simplicity.

## Current Implementation

### Architecture
- Uses `spawn()` to execute each command as a separate process
- No pre-warming or worker processes
- Direct stdio inheritance for full interactivity
- ~200-300ms startup overhead per command (acceptable for Phase 1)

### What's Working ✅

1. **Basic REPL Loop**
   - Interactive shell with `$ ` prompt
   - Command execution with full argument support
   - Quoted string handling in commands
   - Exit command to close the shell

2. **Interactive Features**
   - Y/N confirmation prompts work correctly
   - Password prompts function properly
   - Any command requiring user input works as expected

3. **Signal Handling**
   - Ctrl+C at empty prompt shows `^C` and continues
   - Shell remains stable and doesn't exit accidentally

### Known Limitations ⚠️

1. **Ctrl+C During Commands**
   - Due to Node.js readline behavior, Ctrl+C during command execution doesn't interrupt immediately
   - The signal is processed after the command completes naturally
   - This is a limitation of the readline architecture when paused

2. **No Pre-warming**
   - Each command spawns a new process
   - ~200-300ms startup time per command
   - Acceptable for current usage patterns

## Technical Details

### Why Fork Was Abandoned
1. Complex signal handling between parent and worker
2. Difficulties with stdio routing for interactive prompts
3. Added complexity without significant benefits for Phase 1

### Current Signal Handling
- Readline must be paused to allow child process to receive stdin
- When paused, readline cannot process SIGINT immediately
- Trade-off: Perfect interactive prompts vs immediate Ctrl+C

## Usage

```bash
# Start interactive mode
$ ably interactive

# In the shell
$ apps list
$ channels subscribe my-channel --duration 10
$ apps create  # Interactive prompts work!
$ exit
```

## Future Improvements

### Phase 2: Autocomplete
- Command name completion
- Argument suggestions
- Resource name completion (apps, keys, etc.)

### Phase 3: Command History
- Up/down arrow for previous commands
- Ctrl+R for reverse search

### Phase 4: Enhanced Signal Handling
Consider one of:
- Implement raw mode handling for Ctrl+C detection
- Use node-pty for full terminal emulation
- Accept current limitation as reasonable trade-off

## Conclusion

The interactive mode is functional and provides significant value:
- Eliminates need to type `ably` prefix for every command
- Supports all CLI functionality including interactive prompts
- Provides a stable REPL experience

The Ctrl+C limitation during command execution is a reasonable trade-off for the simplicity and reliability of the current implementation.
