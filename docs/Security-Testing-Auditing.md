# Docker Container Security Testing and Auditing

This document outlines the procedures for testing and auditing the security measures implemented for the Ably CLI's web terminal Docker container.

## Automated Security Testing

Automated tests are crucial for continuously verifying the container's security posture. These tests should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

### CI Implementation

The `.github/workflows/container-security-tests.yml` workflow implements automated security tests that run on every PR and push to the main branch that affects the Docker configuration. The workflow performs the following tests:

1. **Dockerfile Linting:** Uses hadolint to check the Dockerfile for best practices and security issues.
2. **Configuration Verification:** Inspects the container configuration to ensure security settings like ReadonlyRootfs and PidsLimit are properly set.
3. **Filesystem Restrictions:** Tests that the root filesystem is read-only, appropriate directories are writable, and noexec is enforced on tmpfs mounts.
4. **Command Restrictions:** Verifies that the restricted shell blocks command injection attempts via pipe (`|`), semicolon (`;`), and other shell operators.
5. **Network Restrictions:** Tests connectivity to allowed Ably domains and verifies that connections to disallowed domains are blocked.
6. **Security Monitoring:** Confirms that the security logging directory exists and is properly configured.
7. **Vulnerability Scanning:** Uses Trivy to scan the container image for known vulnerabilities.

### Local Testing Script

A bash script `server/docker/test-security.sh` has been created to allow developers to run the same security tests locally. This script:

1. Builds the Docker image if it doesn't exist
2. Runs a comprehensive set of tests to verify security configurations
3. Provides clear, colorized output of test results

To run the tests locally:

```bash
cd docker
./test-security.sh
```

This enables developers to verify container security before committing changes.

### Additional Tests to Consider

1.  **Dockerfile Linting & Scanning:**
    *   Use tools like `hadolint` to check the `Dockerfile` for best practice violations.
    *   Integrate container vulnerability scanning (e.g., Trivy, Snyk) to detect known vulnerabilities in the base image and installed packages.

2.  **Configuration Verification Tests:**
    *   Build the Docker image.
    *   Run a temporary container based on the image.
    *   **Filesystem Checks:**
        *   Verify the root filesystem is read-only (`touch /testfile` should fail).
        *   Verify `tmpfs` mounts (`/tmp`, `/run`, `~/.ably`) exist and have `noexec` applied (attempt to execute a simple script from these locations).
    *   **Resource Limit Checks:**
        *   Inspect the running container's configuration (`docker inspect`) to confirm `PidsLimit`, `Memory`, `MemorySwap`, and `NanoCpus` match the intended values.
        *   (Optional) Attempt to exceed limits (e.g., fork bomb, memory allocation) and verify container termination/restriction.
    *   **Network Security Checks:**
        *   Attempt to connect to disallowed domains/IPs (e.g., `curl google.com`) and verify failure.
        *   Verify connections to allowed Ably endpoints succeed (e.g., `curl https://rest.ably.io/time`).
        *   Verify raw socket usage is blocked.
    *   **Seccomp Profile Checks:**
        *   Attempt to use a blocked syscall (e.g., `ptrace`) and verify failure/logging.
    *   **AppArmor Profile Checks:**
        *   Attempt to execute a non-whitelisted binary and verify failure/logging.
        *   Attempt to access restricted file paths and verify failure/logging.
    *   **User Namespace Checks (if enabled):**
        *   Verify the container runs as a non-root user (`id -u` inside the container should not be 0).
        *   Verify file ownership within the container maps correctly to the host's subuid/subgid range.
    *   **Restricted Shell Checks:**
        *   Attempt command injection techniques (`|`, `&`, `;`, `$()`, etc.) in the restricted shell and verify they are blocked.
        *   Verify only `ably` and `exit` commands are permitted.

3.  **Security Monitoring Script Test:**
    *   Trigger events that should be logged (e.g., blocked network connection, AppArmor denial) and verify logs appear in `/var/log/ably-cli-security/` inside the container.

## Regular Security Audits

Regular manual audits complement automated testing.

**Frequency:** Quarterly (or more often if significant changes occur).

**Workflow:**

1.  **Review Documentation:**
    *   Review `docs/Security-Hardening.md` to ensure it accurately reflects the current implementation.
    *   Review this document (`docs/Security-Testing-Auditing.md`) for relevance and completeness.
2.  **Review Configuration Files:**
    *   Manually inspect the `Dockerfile`.
    *   Review `server/docker/network-security.sh`, `server/docker/enhanced-restricted-shell.sh`, `server/docker/security-monitor.sh`.
    *   Review `server/docker/seccomp-profile.json`.
    *   Review `server/docker/apparmor-profile.conf` (if AppArmor is active).
3.  **Review Automated Test Results:**
    *   Analyze recent CI/CD test runs for failures or warnings related to security tests.
4.  **Dependency Vulnerability Check:**
    *   Manually trigger or review results from vulnerability scanners (e.g., `npm audit`, container scanners) for both the Node.js application and the container's OS packages. Update dependencies as needed.
5.  **Threat Modeling Review:**
    *   Re-evaluate potential attack vectors based on any new features or changes to the CLI or Docker environment.
6.  **Incident Review:**
    *   Review any security incidents or near-misses since the last audit.
7.  **Update Documentation:**
    *   Update hardening and testing documentation based on audit findings.
8.  **Report Findings:**
    *   Document audit findings, required actions, and responsible parties.

# Security Testing and Auditing

This document outlines the testing and auditing procedures implemented to ensure the security of the Docker containers used in the Ably CLI's web terminal feature.

## Automated Tests

### Terminal Server Tests

The terminal server integration tests in `test/integration/terminal-server.test.ts` verify that:

1. The terminal server starts correctly and accepts WebSocket connections
2. Authentication flows work properly and reject unauthorized connections
3. Connection timeouts function correctly to prevent abandoned sessions
4. Commands can be executed within the container
5. Environment variables are properly passed to the container
6. The terminal handles proper terminal sizing and ANSI color output

These tests spin up a real terminal server instance during test execution and connect to it via WebSocket, simulating a real client connection. They test the entire flow from server startup to command execution.

### Docker Container Security Tests

The Docker container security tests in `test/integration/docker-container-security.test.ts` verify that:

1. The container has a read-only root filesystem
2. Process limits are set to prevent fork bombs and resource exhaustion
3. Memory limits are set to prevent memory abuse
4. Temporary filesystems are mounted with `noexec` and `nosuid` flags
5. Unnecessary capabilities are dropped from the container
6. The seccomp profile is properly applied
7. The container runs as a non-root user
8. The restricted network is properly configured
9. The container can only execute allowed commands
10. The container cannot modify unauthorized parts of the filesystem

These tests create an actual Docker container and inspect its configuration to ensure security settings are applied correctly.

## Running Security Tests

The Docker container security tests can be run with:

```bash
pnpm test test/integration/docker-container-security.test.ts
```

The terminal server tests can be run with:

```bash
pnpm test test/integration/terminal-server.test.ts
```

Note that these tests require:
- Docker to be installed and running
- The `ably-cli-sandbox` Docker image to be built
- Sufficient permissions to manage Docker containers

## CI Integration

The GitHub workflow in `.github/workflows/container-security-tests.yml` automatically runs these security tests on every pull request that changes Dockerfile or Docker-related files.

## Manual Security Audits

In addition to automated tests, periodic manual security audits should be performed to identify any potential vulnerabilities:

1. **Container Escape Attempts**: Test if privileged operations or filesystem access can bypass security restrictions.

2. **Network Security**: Verify that containers can only communicate with authorized endpoints.

3. **Resource Limit Testing**: Verify that resource limits are enforced by attempting to exceed them.

4. **Command Injection**: Test edge cases for command injection in the restricted shell.

5. **External Vulnerability Scanning**: Run tools like Docker Bench Security, Clair, or Trivy against the container images.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow the responsible disclosure procedure outlined in the main README. Do not post security vulnerabilities in public issues.
